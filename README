				———————————————————————————

Sorting Algorithms is a program that implements the Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Randomized Quick Sort sorting algorithms on three different data trends: Randomized, Ordered, and Reverse-Ordered. The algorithms are tested on varying array sizes ranging from 25,000 to 100,000. It then times each algorithm on each data set and outputs the run time of each algorithm.

To compile:

1) Move to designated directory holding main.cpp and associated files.
2) Prompt> make
3) Prompt> ./SortingAlgorithms.exe

SortingAlgorithms uses arrays of varying sizes to hold the numbers that need to be sorted. The arrays are initialized in sizes of 25,000, 50,000, 75,000 and 100,000.

The best-case run times of Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Randomized Quick Sort respectively are Ω(n), Ω(nlogn), Ω(nlogn), Ω(nlogn).

The worst-case run times of Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Randomized Quick Sort respectively are Ω(n^2), Ω(nlogn), Ω(n^2), Ω(nlogn).

BestFirstSearch contains main.cpp, used as a driver for each of the 4 Sorting Algorithms.
